MANIFEST INFORMATION 

ICON 
Here's an example of how to declare the icons in the manifest:

 "icons": {
    "16": "icon16.png",
    "32": "icon32.png",
    "48": "icon48.png",
    "128": "icon128.png"
  },


Since manifest 3, anonymous functions are not allowed (neither in background).
Jquery.js file usually has anonymous functions You should set a name to them.
