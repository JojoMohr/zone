Unfortunately Manifest V3 does not allow sounds to be played from the background script. Therefore the extension can as of now only be installed manually. 
Therefore simply download the repo and go to chrome://extensions/ , switch into Developer Mode in the upper right corner and click on "Load Unpacked Extension". 
Now you should be able to select the "zone" folder from your maschine and add it to your personal extensions. 


Bugs: 
The timer is still not working properly, be my guest and pull the project to fix it :)
